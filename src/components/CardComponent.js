            E-waste, electronic waste, e-scrap and end-of-life electronics are terms often used to describe used electronics 
            that are nearing the end of their useful life, and are discarded, donated or given to a recycler. The UN defines 
            e-waste as any discarded products with a battery or plug, and features toxic and hazardous substances such as mercury, 
            that can pose severe risk to human and environmental health.

              It’s predicted that by 2030, global e-waste will reach 74 million metric tons - almost a doubling in just 16 years, making e-waste the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream. In 2019 alone, a record 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated worldwide.

              Prof Richard Herrington, Head of Earth Sciences at the Museum, shares some tips for how to dispose of unwanted electronics and tells us about an innovative urban mining project.
              If you have a few redundant or broken electronics languishing in drawers at home, you're not alone. The UK is one of the largest producers of household e-waste in the world and we can all be part of the solution.

              <Card.Title>The Philippines: making money making e-waste safe</Card.Title>
              <Card.Text>
              MANILA - The United Nations’ most recent Global E-Waste Monitor report estimates that electronic waste generated worldwide will exceed 74 million metric tonnes by 2030.

Higher consumption of electrical and electronic equipment, as well as short life cycles and limited repair options, will drive the increase.

According to the report, the Philippines is among Southeast Asia's top e-waste generators. The country is estimated to have generated 3.9 kg of e-waste per capita in 2019.

          <h1>Environmental Risks</h1>
            <p>
            E-waste can be toxic, is not biodegradable and accumulates in the environment, in the soil, air, water and living things. 
            For example, open-air burning and acid baths being used to recover valuable materials from electronic components release toxic 
            materials leaching into the environment. These practices can also expose workers to high levels of contaminants such as lead, mercury, 
            beryllium, thallium, cadmium and arsenic, and also brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polychlorinated biphenyls, which can lead to 
            irreversible health effects, including cancers, miscarriages, neurological damage and diminished IQs.

          <h1>At 59 Million Tons, Our E-Waste Problem Is Getting Out of Control</h1>
            <p>
            With each passing year, our electronics—all the smartphones, laptops, monitors, TVs, speakers, and other personal devices that, 
            for better or for worse, have become indispensable to modern life—get smaller, slimmer, and more lightweight. One of the earliest 
            laptops, the Macintosh PowerBook 100, weighed more than five pounds when it was released in 1991; the lightest laptop currently on 
            the market is less than two. The lightest phone you can find today weighs in at just over three ounces, less than a deck of playing cards. 
            And as wireless technology continues to develop, we need fewer and fewer of the cords and cables that we once relied on for connectivity.

            <h1>India's e-waste recycling "markets" are toxic nightmares filled with child laborers</h1>
            <p>
            India passed comprehensive e-waste recycling regulations in 2016, but they are not well enforced. Researchers from the UNSW report from Seelampur 
            and Mandoli, two slums outside of Delhi, where the kabadiwalas (also called raddiwalas) work to dismantle truckloads of e-waste that are dumped there each day.
            The workers of Seelampur and Mandoli, many of them children, lack even the most basic safety equipment: 
            many work without goggles, masks, gloves, or work-shoes, and work with unsuitable and primitive tools to remove
            precious metals and component from the guts of appliances, phones and other electronics.
